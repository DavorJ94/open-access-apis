# List of available APIs

This web page contains a list of available APIs, with appropriate links that redirect to the web page of that respective API.

The idea is obtained from Scrimba course. Design and code is my own. The main idea is to use grid tool in css to create a list of APIs.

Basically, API was used to represent the list of available APIs.
